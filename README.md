# HiveMind Insiders - Feature Tracker

Open issues with feature requests and I will consider working on it!

Vote on features with emojis :+1: :-1:

Issues are labeled according to their current working state:
- Idea - a suggestion that might be worked on or not, no code exists for this
- Proof Of Concept - The idea has been explored before and might even have worked at some point, but not maintained
- Work in Progress - It is being worked on! but don't expect it to be easy to get going or necessarily in a working state
- Minimum Viable Product - Usable code already exists! exclusive for sponsors
